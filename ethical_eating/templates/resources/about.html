                Vegetarianism is not traditionally a component of mainstream Judaism. Judaism is instead centered around
                Kosher rituals for the consumption of animal products. There are, however, arguments for the integration
                of vegetarianism into Judaism. Genesis 1:29 states "And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb
                yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit—to
                you it shall be for food." Many scholars see the Torah as thereby pointing to vegetarianism as an ideal,
                as Adam and Eve did not partake of the flesh of animals as all humans and animals were originally
                commanded by God to only eat plants. According to some interpretations, God's original plan was for
                mankind to be vegetarian, and God only later gave permission for man to eat meat in a covenant with Noah
                (Genesis 9:1–17) as a temporary concession because of Man's weak nature. This concessionary view of
                meat-consumption is based on the scriptural analysis of several Rishonim.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Torah gives precise details on how animals are to be sacrificed and slaughtered (shechita).
                According to Rabbis Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz and Abraham Isaac Kook the complexity of these laws were
                intended to discourage the consumption of meat. Kashrut may also be designed to discourage killing
                living beings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some writers assert that the Jewish prophet Isaiah was a vegetarian, on the basis of passages in the
                Book of Isaiah that extol nonviolence and reverence for life, such as Isaiah 1:11, 11:6-9, 65:25, and
                66:3. Some of these writers refer to "the vegetarian Isaiah", "the notorious vegetarian Isaiah", and
                "Isaiah, the vegetarian prophet". Critics of this view argue that none of the Biblical verses in
                question refer to a human diet: they either condemn certain animal sacrifices, or else prophesize
                that carnivorous animals will become herbivorous at the end of days.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Daniel 1:8-16, the pious Jewish youths Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused
                to eat food or drink wine served in Nebuchadnezzar's palace. At Daniel's request, the four boys were
                subjected to a test; they were fed only vegetables and water for ten days. At the end of the ten days,
                the four boys were in better condition than the other boys who ate the king's food.[13] The youths chose
                to eat this food because the king's food was non-kosher, not because the king's food was non-vegan.
            </p>
            <p>
                A number of ancient Jewish sects, including early Karaite sects, regarded the eating of meat as
                prohibited as long as Zion was in ruins and Israel in exile.
            </p>
            <p>
                A number of medieval scholars of Judaism, such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama, regard vegetarianism
                as a moral ideal, not out of a concern for animal welfare per se but out of a concern for the moral
                character of the slaughterer. Rabbeinu Asher ben Meshullam was said to have never tasted meat.

                There are several religious and philosophical arguments used by modern Jewish vegetarians regarding the
                ethics of eating meat. According to some, vegetarianism is consistent with the sacred teachings and
                highest ideals of Judaism, including compassion, health, life, conservation of resources, tzedakah,
                kashrut, peace, and justice. In contrast, the mass production and consumption of meat and other animal
                products contradicts many Jewish values and teachings, gravely harming people, animals, communities, and
                the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                One mitzvah cited by vegetarians is tza'ar ba'alei hayyim; the injunction not to cause "pain to living
                creatures." The laws of shechita are meant to prevent the suffering of animals. However, factory farming
                and high-speed mechanized kosher slaughterhouses have been criticized for failing to meet the essence of
                shechita. Jonathan Safran Foer narrated the short documentary film If This Is Kosher..., which records
                what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another mitzvah often cited by Jewish vegetarians is bal tashchit; the law which prohibits waste. They
                suggest that an omnivorous diet is wasteful, since it uses 5 times more grain, 10 times more water, 15
                times more land and 20 times more energy when compared to a vegan diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some Jewish vegetarians also stress the commandment to maintain one's health and not harm oneself
                (venishmartem me'od lenafshoteichem), and point to research indicating that following a vegetarian diet
                promotes better health. Jewish vegetarians have also argued for environmental vegetarianism, pointing
                out that global warming, hunger and the depletion of natural resources can be lessened by a global shift
                to a vegetarian or vegan diet.
